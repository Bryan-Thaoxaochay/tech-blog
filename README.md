## What I Learned

### List
1. MVC Directory 

Having the directory organized through MVC helps a lot. Although there are still a lot of files, I know where every file is.

2. Handlebars

- linking to other webpages
I thought it would be difficult to link webpages in handlebars, but it may actually be easier than HTML.
- if/else
Having this built-in helper was helpful when deciding what needs to be displayed.
- each
Being able to do a for each in the handlebar really decreased the amount of code necessary in the JavaScript files.

3. Models


4. Modules
- dotenv


5. Routing

- rendering
I am getting more use to using routes along with the methods. With the routing and JavaScript, it really makes the website much more dynamic.

6. JavaScript

I am getting use to using front-end JavaScript with the back-end routing. It was necessary for many functions, such as logging in, logout timer, and displaying the info from MySQL.
- fetch
- login, logout


7. Helpers

- Date Formatting
A helper function made it really simple converting the date from MySQL into the correct format.
